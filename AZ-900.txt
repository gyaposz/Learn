Cloud computing:
	What is cloud computing
	Share Responsibility Model:
		IAAS - Infrastructure as a Service - most amount of responsibilities, most configurable
		PAAS - Platform as a Service
		SAAS - Software as a Service - least amount of responsibilities, least configurable
	Cloud Models:
		Private cloud: used by one entity
		Public cloud: used by many entities
		Hybrid cloud: both private and public
		Multi cloud: multiple public cloud providers
	Azure Arc: Helping managing cloud model
	Azure VMware solutions: VMware workloads in public cloud
	Consumption based model
	Pricing model

		Data Lake Storage Gen2
		Azure Files: NFS
		Queue Storage: SQS
		Table Storage
	Storage Options:
		Locally redundant storage (LRS): 3 times redundant in a single datacenter on primary region
		Geo-redundant storage (GRS): 3 times redundant in both primary and secondary regions
		Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS): Can you read from secondary?
		Zone-redundant storage (ZRS): 3 times redundant across 3 AZs in primary region
		Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS): 3 times redundant across 3 AZs in primary and 3 times redundant in secondary region
		Read-access geo-zone-redundant storage (RA-GZRS): Can you read from secondary?
	Migration:
		Azure Migrate: Migration from on-premise to Azure:
			Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment
			Azure Migrate: Server Migration
			Data Migration Assistant
			Azure Database Migration Service
			Web app migration assistant
		Azure Data Box
			80TB
	Tools:
		AzCopy: CLI for moving files and blobs from to Azure storage account
		Azure Storage Explorer: GUI on top of AzCopy
		Azure File Sync: centralized file share for Windows
Azure identity, access and security:
	Azure AD
		Similar to Active Directory, but in the cloud
		Identity and access management service
		Tasks:
			Authentication with self-service, MFA, banned pwds and smart lockout, passwordless
			SSO
			Application Management: application proxy, My Apps portal, SaaS apps
			Device Management: device registration
		Azure AD Connect: to connect on-premise AD to Azure AD.
		Azure AD Domain Services: Kerberos authentication, LDAP, group policy, domain join
			For legacy application without possibility of modern authentication
		Azure AD syncs to Azure AD DS, but not vice versa.
		So on-premise AD -> Azure AD -> Azure AD DS.
		Passwordless: Ms Authenticator: something you have, something you are, something you know.
	External Identities:
		Person, device, service outside of organization
		Identity brought from goverment-issued digital identity or unmanaged social identity
		Azure AD External Identities
		B2B collaboration: External Identities may use resources in your account, shown as guest users in directory
		B2B direct connect: between to Azure ADs. Supported only by Teams shared channels currently.
		Azure AD business to customer: Apps to customers
	Azure Conditional Access:
		Based on sign-in information collected by conditional access, user may not be challenged with MFA if signed in from a known location. Who the user is, where the user is, what device the user use.
		Or the access to an application may be blocked partially or entirely.
	Azure Role Based Access Control: RBAC
		Least Privilege Principle
		Instead individual level, use RBAC group for common resource accessibility
		Access may not be directly to resources, but to scopes.
		Scope can be resources, RGs, subscriptions or management groups.
	Zero Trust Model:
		Verify explicitly: always authenticate and authorize
		Use least privilege access
		Assume breach: minimize blast radius and segment access, E2E encryption, analytics, threat detection, improve defenses
	Defense-in-depth:
		Physical
		Identity and access
		Perimeter (DDoS, firewall)
		Network (deny by default, limit communication, secure connectivity, limit inbound/outbound)
		Compute (Patched systems, secure access to VMs)
		Application (secure storage of secrets, free of vulnerabilities)
		Data (secure data)
	Microsoft Defender for Cloud:
		Monitoring tool for cloud, on-premise, hybrid or multi-cloud
		Azure Arc helps extend Defender for Cloud on non-Azure machines.
		Defender for Cloud deploys Log Analytics to collect information
		Many Azure services use defender without deploying anything.
		What it does is:
			Assess:
				regular detail vulnerabilities scans
			Secure:
				Azure security benchmark: Provides list of recommendations
			Alerts
Cost in Azure:
	Calculate:
		TCO Calculator - total cost of ownership, compare on-premise with cloud
		Pricing Calculator - which resource fits my budget, estimate costs
		Azure Advisor - unused resources, optimisation, accidental cost overruns
		Cost Management Tool - bills, costs, etc.
			- Budget Alerts - reaching defined amount of the condition
			- Credit Alerts - credit monetary commitments are consumed.
			- Department spending Quota Alerts 
Governance:
	Azure Blueprints: Cloudformation but for packaging and sharing policies, artifacts etc. ARM is for resource groups
	Azure Policies: AWS Config
		Make sure that everybody obeys the rules
		Azure Policy Initiatives: grouping related policies together
	Resource Locks: Resources cannot be deleted even with available rights
		Delete: still can read or modify, but cannot delete resources
		ReadOnly: can read, but cannot delete or modify resources
	Service Trust Portal:
		Microsoft's implementation of controls and processes to protect cloud and data
		GDPR, PCI, etc.
Features and tools:
	Communcation with Azure:
		Azure Portal
		Azure Cloud Shell
		Azure Powershell - for powershell
		Azure CLI - for bash
	Azure Arc: For hybrid and multi-cloud solutions
		non-Azure resources projected in Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
		Manage Kubernetes clusters as if in Azure
		familiar Azure services
		Used for:
			Servers, Kubernetes clusters, Azure data services, SQL Server and VM
	ARM and Azure ARM template:
		Azure Blueprints applies policies in an automated fashion and ARM Templates allow you to deploy your resource as code. Using the two together helps ensure that youâ€™re deploying consistent, compliant resources.
	Azure Advisor:
		help improve reliability, security, and performance, achieve operational excellence, and reduce costs
