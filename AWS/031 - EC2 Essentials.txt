EC2 is acronim for Elastic Cloud Compute. They are Virtual Servers in the Cloud.
EC2 purchase option:
In Amazon we only pay what we use, but we can configure what we use:
	- Spot Instance:
		- Bid on unused EC2 instances
		- But cannot be used for disruption intolerant services
	
	- Reserved Instance:
		- Pay down EC2 price upfront and guarantee compute time in an AZ
		- 1 year, 3 year upfront
		- Can save time if you have a compute intense service running 24 hours a day
		- If AZ is going down then you will have priority over on-demand instances.
		
	- On-demand Instance:
		- Regular hourly price based on the size of the instances (micro is about a penny/minute)
	- Free Tier Instance
		- 750 hours of compute time.
	
Amazon EC2-Classic limits by default:
	- 5 Elastic IP Addresses
	- 20 Instances per account
